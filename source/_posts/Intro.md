# Welcome to My Technical Journey

Having been an algorithm engineer for 7+ years, I've witnessed and participated in the incredible evolution of AI technology - from the early days of computer vision to today's large language model revolution.

## My Story

My journey began in **Computer Vision** back in 2018, when I started as a CV Algorithm Engineer at ADVANCE.AI in Singapore, working on face detection and liveness detection systems. Those were exciting times - we were pushing the boundaries of what traditional CNN architectures could achieve, and every breakthrough felt monumental.

From there, I dove deeper into the world of **Person Re-identification** and **License Plate Recognition** at PENSEES, where I had the opportunity to experiment with Transformer architectures for vision tasks - this was even before Vision Transformer (ViT) became mainstream! Working with Deformable Transformers and deploying models on edge devices like Nvidia Jetson Nano taught me the critical balance between model performance and real-world constraints.

The journey took an interesting turn when I joined **Zhejiang Shizai Intelligence** in 2021, where I transitioned from pure CV work to building **intelligent RPA systems** and **desktop AI agents**. This experience taught me that great AI isn't just about perfect algorithms - it's about creating systems that genuinely solve real problems for users.

Most recently, I've been diving deep into the **Large Language Model** ecosystem, working on everything from RAG systems and intelligent agents to industrial data analysis platforms. The rapid pace of innovation in this space is both thrilling and challenging - every month brings new paradigms and possibilities.

## What You'll Find Here

Through this blog, I'll be sharing:

- **Technical deep-dives** into algorithms and architectures I've worked with
- **Engineering insights** from deploying AI systems in production
- **Lessons learned** from 7 years of building AI products across different domains
- **Thoughts on the future** of AI and where the industry is heading

Whether you're a fellow engineer, a student getting started in AI, or someone curious about the intersection of theory and practice in machine learning, I hope you'll find something valuable here.

## Beyond the Code

When I'm not debugging model architectures or optimizing inference pipelines, you might find me exploring the latest research papers, tinkering with new frameworks, or thinking about how AI can be made more accessible and beneficial for everyone.

I've been fortunate to work across different cultures and continents - from Australia (where I studied AI at ANU) to Singapore and China - and these experiences have shaped my perspective on building technology that works for diverse global audiences.
